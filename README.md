# Welcome to My Portfolio!

### I’m a soon to be graduated computer science student looking for software engineering / software developer jobs. I specialize in cybersecurity and have experience writing and optimizing efficient code, so I can help your organization write secure and fast applications. I’m also a fast learner, a great teammate, I have leadership experience, and I love programming and learning new things.
