# Database-Website Interface Project

### [Repository](https://github.com/GabrielSJones/CS360-project){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

- Website that searches for products / services in a database and displays the results
- 3 required types of searches on the website:
	- Search 1 is just text-based name matching search
	- Search 2 is an attribute-based search for products in the database
	- Search 3 is an attribute-based search for services in the database
- Also has pages where you can add, remove, and edit rows in the database
- Used Xampp to localhost the website
- Used phpmyadmin to host the database
- Created in Spring of 2022 in under a month by me and a partner for a final project in a Database Systems class
