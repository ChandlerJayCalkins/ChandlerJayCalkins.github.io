# Capstone Meeting Discord Bot

### [Repository](https://github.com/ChandlerJayCalkins/Capstone-Meeting-Bot){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

- Discord bot that keeps track of meetings for senior engineering capstone design teams at the University of Idaho
- Made in Janruary 2023 by me for fun and practice
- Keeps track of both one time meetings and weekly meetings
- Keeps track of which team member is on certain duties
- Also keep track of birthdays
- Sends alerts in teams' discord servers when it's almost time for a meeting and when a meeting starts
- Made the bot so my capstone team could keep track of our meetings and duties more easily (and also so I could have another thing to use my newly acquired raspberry pi for)
- Made the bot open for other capstone teams to use once it was done
