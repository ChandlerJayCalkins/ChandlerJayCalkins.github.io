# Python Viruses

### [Repository](https://github.com/ChandlerJayCalkins/UIdahoCS336VirusPresentation)

- Multiple demo viruses for Windows that infect other python files
	- Virus 1 infects python files with a comment just to show how to infect files
	- Virus 2 infects python files with code that makes the victim's keyboard unusable
		- Infected file creates a script in the Windows startup directory and runs it
		- The script turns off capslock, numlock, and scroll lock repeatedly so lights flash on and off on the victim's keyboard
		- The script also spams the string "lol " over and over again through the keyboard so the victim can't type anything
	- Virus 3 does the same thing as virus 2 except it's polymorphic, so it's much harder for anti-virus software to detect files infected by it
	- The discord virus infects discord bots and makes them kick everyone from a server and delete all of the channels
- Repository also has virus that make discord bots kick everyone from a server and delete all of the channels
- Made in fall 2021 for a presentation in Introduction to Information Assurance class to demonstrate viruses
- All viruses were made by me in about a week
- Professor offered to hire me for a research opporunity after the presentation
