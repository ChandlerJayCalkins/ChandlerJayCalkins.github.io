# Quad-Legged Walking Bot

### [Repository](https://github.com/Robot-Builders-Team-University-of-Idaho/Quad_Walker_Bot){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

- WIP code for a 4-legged robot that can walk through a maze and solve the maze as it goes
- Made by Mobile Robot Team in the University of Idaho Robotics Club
- Project started Fall of 2022 and will continue to Spring of 2023 or beyond
- I'm the only computer science major on the team and the lead software developer
- I created the repository and all of the code so far
- I've been using this project to practice making a well maintained and easy-to-use codebase for the rest of the team
	- Creating simplified wrapper SDKs to interface with the robot's parts so teammates can have an easier time programming the robot
	- Creating documentation for our code so teammates can learn the codebase more easily
	- Creating standards for the team to follow when contributing to the repository to keep it organized
